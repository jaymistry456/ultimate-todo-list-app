# Description of Sketches

- I had some intuition in my mind on the design of the to do list.
- The sketches on the first page correspond to the view of how the to do list would like without any intricate details.
- The next page lays out the details on how the information would look in the application.
- The sketch on third page lays out on how I was planning to organize the different parts of the view, for example, where the navigation for the tasks, meetings and shopping would go and where the navigation for the subsections like today, upcoming and so on would go.
- Then, in the sketches on the forth page, I added Meeting the Shopping views in the application.
- Lastly, I added how Help and About pages would look like in the application in the forth and fifth page of the pdf.
